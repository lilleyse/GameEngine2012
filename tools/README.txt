The "tools" folder is where we put all the build scripts. 
This document explains the process of building properly.

When you should rebuild:
-When someone has added files (or changed file names) to the git repo.
-When there is no build folder
-When there have been changes to the premake4.lua file
Note: You do not have to delete the build folder (premake4.lua takes care of that)
Note: Is is recommended that you rebuild after every pull (just for safety)

=================
Premake:
Premake is a build configuration tool that allows us to develop in Windows, MacOS, or Linux using several different IDE's 
Premake generates a folder which contains project settings for Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, make, etc. The solution files in the build folder reference the contents of our repository, meaning we can run our project without cluttering the repository with autogenerated files.
Premake requires a configuration file called "premake4.lua".

Building:
-First cd into the directory containing the premake4.lua file

-To build in windows :
"./premake4.exe" --platform=x32 --os=windows vs2010
OR ---> double-click "win32_build_automator.bat" (default configuration of windows 32-bit and vs2010)

Other OS's will come later
